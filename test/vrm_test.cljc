;; Real bug regression (net-babiniku ADR-2607071600 M6 slice-2, found the same cycle as
;; the inverseBindMatrices-growth bug above): compose's mesh remap only redirected which
;; ACCESSOR a JOINTS_0 attribute points to, never remapped the per-vertex joint-index
;; VALUES inside it -- so those values kept meaning "position in the DONOR's own skin
;; joint array" even after every mesh was bound to the ONE unified skin, whose joint
;; order can differ entirely from any individual donor's. Symptom: with the
;; inverseBindMatrices-growth bug fixed, a composed avatar loaded without crashing but
;; rendered visibly distorted (confirmed against real VRM Consortium avatars in a real
;; browser). This isolates the bug on a minimal fixture designed so the WRONG answer and
;; the RIGHT answer are unambiguously different values, not just "doesn't crash."
