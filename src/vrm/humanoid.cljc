  "VRM humanoid bone mapping <-> `kotoba-lang/skeleton`-shaped skeleton
  conversion. Restored from `kami-vrm/src/humanoid.rs`
  (kotoba-lang/kami-engine, deleted PR #82) as part of the clj-wgsl migration
  (ADR-2607010930, com-junkawasaki/root).

  The original depended on the sibling `kami-skeleton` Rust crate's
  `Bone`/`Skeleton` types; here we produce a `kotoba-lang/skeleton`-compatible
  plain-map shape directly (no cross-repo dependency, per the CLJC
  restoration convention: `{:bones [{:name :parent :local-position
  :local-rotation :local-scale :inverse-bind} ...]}`)."
