  "Classify a mesh node into a category keyword by name heuristics (VRoid
  Studio naming: \"Body\", \"Hair\", \"Face\", \"FaceEyeline\", ...; generic:

  Real bug fix (/loop maturity pass, ADR-2607031200): checks `mesh-name`
  ALONE first, before falling back to the combined mesh+node+material blob.
  Confirmed against a real production VRM (not committed; a hand-built
  synthetic fixture reproduces the same shape) that the old combined-blob-
  first approach mis-classified a mesh literally named \"wear\" (clothing) as
  `:face`, because ONE of its many attached materials happened to be named
  \"robo_face\" (a visor/faceplate texture -- coincidental substring, not a
  facial feature) -- a false positive from a keyword match on unrelated
  material soup outranking the mesh's own, much stronger, direct name. A
  mesh's own name is VRoid Studio's most reliable signal (it consistently
  names meshes \"Hair\"/\"Body\"/\"Face\"/\"Wear\" directly); material/node
  names are only consulted as a fallback when the mesh name alone gives no
  match (e.g. a generic mesh name with descriptive material names)."
